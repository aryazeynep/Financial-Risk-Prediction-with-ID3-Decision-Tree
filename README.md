# Financial-Risk-Prediction-with-ID3-Decision-Tree

In this project, my classmate and I implemented a Decision Tree model using the ID3 algorithm to predict financial risk based on a dataset of 15,000 individuals. Each entry contains 19 attributes, some of which include missing values.

The project consists of two parts:

- Building a decision tree from scratch using the ID3 algorithm

- Applying pruning techniques to improve generalization performance (better accuracy on unseen data)

Key steps:

We applied a custom strategy to handle missing data, which is clearly explained in the code and comments.

The dataset was randomly split into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets.

Evaluation metrics were used to assess both the unpruned and pruned decision tree models.

Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in implementing tree-based learning, handling real-world data issues, and improving model performance via pruning.
